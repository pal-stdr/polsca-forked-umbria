# 1. How to `rename` a git branch `locally` & in `remote`

- First rename in the local. Then do the things in the remote. [SO: git: how to rename a branch (both local and remote)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30590083/git-how-to-rename-a-branch-both-local-and-remote)

## 1.1. Local

```sh
# If you are on the branch you want to rename:
git branch -m new-name

# if you stay on a different branch at the current time:
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

## 1.2. Remote

- Concept: In remote, it's not actually renaming. First, You have to remove the old branch from the remote. Then you push the new branch from local.

```sh
# Delete the remote branch
git push origin :old_branch_name    // Delete the remote branch

# Push the renamed branch to remote & set it to upstream
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch_name
```

- (Optional) If you want to do it in one line

```sh
git push -u origin :old_name new_name
```
